# jtextiles

A java library for creating and exploring Nasu's textile systems. Textile systems play a crucial role in studying automorphisms and endomorphisms of shifts of finite type. 

A textile system is a pair of graph homomorphisms (*p*,*q*: Î“ -> *G*). We obtain an automorphism of the edge shift *X<sub>G</sub>* by the induced block map of the composition of the graph homomorphisms.
